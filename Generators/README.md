# Generators

First lets understand iterators. According to Wikipedia, an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. However, an iterator performs traversal and gives access to data elements in a container, but does not perform iteration. You might be confused so lets take it a bit slow. There are three parts namely:

Iterable
Iterator
Iteration
All of these parts are linked to each other. We will discuss them one by one and later talk about generators.
